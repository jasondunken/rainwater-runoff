                            R3 Monitoring System
Providing Real Time Remote Sensor Data Monitoring, Validation, and Fault Notification

    The initial system Roof Rainwater Runoff (R3) Monitoring System is intended to 
improve upon utilizes sondes provided by EnviroDiy (www.envirodiy.org/). These 
sondes are based on an Arduino single board computer (SBC) called the 
Mayfly Data Logger (www.envirodiy.org/mayfly/). The Mayfly SBC runs an open-source 
script (github.com/EnviroDIY/EnviroDIY_Mayfly_Logger) that directs sonde data to 
the Monitor My Watershed (monitormywatershed.org/) servers. Sensor data is discoverable 
from Monitor My Watershed. Monitor My Watershed does not facilitate real time data 
monitoring or generate any user notification if invalid sensor data is received. 
Currently Monitor My Watershed provides, 

    "Only the most recent 72 hours of available data are shown on the 
    sparkline plots. The plots are broken when there are gaps in the data 
    longer than 6 hours. Plots shaded in green have recent data. 
    Plots shaded in red have not reported data in the last 72 hours."

The Roof Rainwater Runoff (R3) Monitoring System is comprised of three primary components:
- Arduino based sondes running a customized script based on open source examples
- A server that receives, validates, and stores sensor data and metadata
- A web interface for site/sonde management and data exploration
